# How to use this system

## General

This implementation of Mythic Bastionland by Chris McDowall for Foundry VTT includes comprehensive compendiums. These compendiums encompass all the knights, items, NPCs, and tables as described in the [Quickstart Rules](https://bit.ly/mbplaytest).

## Generating Knights & Squires
You can randomly generate a knight or a squire by clicking the corresponding 'Generate' button in the Actors tab.

_Note: Players must have the 'Create Actor' permission, configured through Foundry's permission settings, to be allowed to generate knights and squires._

## Generating a Warband
The Gamemaster can randomly generate a warband using the corresponding button in the Actors tab.

## Generating a NPC
The Gamemaster can randomly generate various NPCs by clicking the 'Generate NPC' button in the Actors Tab. A window will appear, allowing the Gamemaster to configure the NPC. This includes generating companions and a biography using the Sparks table.

Note: When generating an NPC knight, the 'random weapons and armors' field will not be utilized if one of the 12 knights from the Quickstart Guide is generated.

## Actor Toolbar
At the top of each actor's sheet, buttons are available to assist players with various actions. These include attacking, taking damage, losing virtues, resting, restoring attributes, rolling for a scar, and adding an item.

## Referee Dashboard
The referee dashboard in Foundry VTT can be accessed through a button located in the top left corner. This dashboard is exclusively accessible to the gamemaster, allowing them to access all the roll tables.
